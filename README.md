# BuyAll

Your one-stop for all your medicine needs, just a click away.

## Use Case

This pandemic situation has crippled many suburban dwellers and villagers, especially for medical facilities. They have to travel far at times for some medicines which makes things complicated for them. They are not able to afford such extra expenses for medicines. Also going so far from their homes can invite much trouble. Taking into consideration all these problems, we bring them BuyAll, a platform that helps them order medicines and get them delivered at their village or suburb commonplace by the use of local transport that visits their place. This will not only help the pharmacists, but also the local transporters will generate more revenue out of it. This makes us walk the ‘Vocal For Local’ path as asked for by our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in such difficult times. So just place your order by giving in the necessary details to us through this app and get your medicines delivered at the earliest.
